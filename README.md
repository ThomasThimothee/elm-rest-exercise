### How to run
Clone the repository
Via java IDE launch run the server (should be running on port 8080, if not modify the url in the elm.client)
Launch "elm-reactor" in the folder containing the elm client (if you launch the elm-reactor somewhere else you run the risk of not 
having all depencencies)
```
## Results
When clicking on the buttons, the counter doesn't change, however when open browser to the server side, we can see that the get requests did increment 
the counter and the post request, reset it to 1.
So I my requests seem to work but somehow I can't manage to retrieve the counter and display it in the view.
